        <name title="graebner">Graebner</name> is nervous. He looks down at his feet sombrely. This
        is Forest Hills, and this is one of the semifinal matches in the first United States Open
        Championships. Graebner and Ashe are both Americans. The other semifinalists are a Dutchman
        and an Australian. It has been thirteen years since an American won the men’s-singles final
        at Forest Hills, and this match will determine whether Ashe or Graebner is to have a chance
        to be the first American since Tony Trabert to win it all. Ashe and Graebner are still
        amateurs, and it was imagined that in this tournament, playing against professionals, they
        wouldn’t have much of a chance. But they are here, close to the finish, playing each other.
        For Graebner to look across a net and see Ashe—and the reverse—is not in itself unusual.
        They were both born in 1943, they have known each other since they were thirteen, and they
        have played tournaments and exhibitions and have practiced together in so many countries and
        season that details blur. They are members of the United States Davis Cup Team and, as such,
        travel together throughout the year, playing for the United States—and also entering general
        tournaments less as individuals than en bloc, with the team.
